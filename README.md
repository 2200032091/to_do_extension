# Chrome To-Do Extension â€” Personal Productivity Boost
**_One tab. Zero excuses._**
> *"If itâ€™s out of sight, itâ€™s out of mind."*

Thatâ€™s me. Every. Single. Time. So I built this simple, clean to-do list that lives in my Chrome new tab â€” right where my distractions usually begin. Now instead of wandering off into random clicks, I get a reminder of what actually matters.

## âœ¨ What it does

- Add your tasks and categorize them if you want.
- Set deadlines to keep things real.
- Update, delete, or drag around your tasks â€” itâ€™s chill and flexible.
- All saved locally â€” nothing fancy or synced (yet ðŸ‘€).

## ðŸ”¥ Why I built this

I wanted something lightweight, personal, and minimal â€” something that kicks in **before** I lose myself to infinite scrolls or impulse searches.

No extra tabs. No signups. Just a simple nudge toward productivity every time I open Chrome.

##  Whatâ€™s next?

Letâ€™s just sayâ€¦ this isnâ€™t the final form. Weâ€™ve got plans. Something more immersive, more dynamic â€” something thatâ€™ll *live* on your screen in ways you havenâ€™t seen before.

But hey, one thing at a time ðŸ˜‰

##  Getting Started

Just load this up as an unpacked Chrome extension and you're good to go:
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable **Developer mode**
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select the project folder

Boom ðŸ’¥
